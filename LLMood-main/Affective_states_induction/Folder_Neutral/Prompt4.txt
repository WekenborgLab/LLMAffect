Now follow these steps to calm yourself.
Step 1 - WHAT IS HERE? (BECOMING AWARE) 
Notice your posture. Straighten your spine and generally relax the body. With your eyes either open or closed, silently ask yourself: "What is my experience right now ... in my thoughts ... my feelings ... and my bodily sensations?" Recognise and accept your experience, even if it is unwanted. 

Step 2 - BREATHING (GATHERING) 
Then, gently redirect your full attention to your breathing, to each in breath and to each out breath as they follow, one after the other. Try noting at the back of your mind: "Breathing in ... breathing out" or counting the breaths. Do this for one or two minutes as best you can, using the breathing as an anchor to bring you into the present and help you tune into a state of awareness and stillness. 

Step 3 - EXPANDING OUTWARDS 
Open the field of your awareness around your breathing, so that it includes a sense of the body as a whole, your posture, and facial expression. Allow your attention to expand to the whole body - including any sense of discomfort, tension, or resistance. If these sensations are there, then bring your awareness to them by "breathing into them" on the in breath. Then, breathe out from those sensations, softening and opening with the out breath. If you wish, you can say to yourself on the out breath, “It's OK. Whatever it is, it's OK. Let me feel it. It is here already so I may as well be present for it." As best you can, bring this expanded awareness to the next moments of your day.
