Please read this text carefully. Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, gained national attention for using military funerals as a backdrop for an anti-military protest. The church believes that the United States is too tolerant of sin and that the death of American soldiers is God's punishment for that tolerance. In March 2006 Phelps and his daughters picketed near the funeral for Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, who had died in Iraq a week earlier. The Marine's Humvee rolled over while he was manning the gun turret. Police had kept picketers at least 200 feet from the funeral procession, but they were in clear view of the people attending the funeral. The demonstrators' signs included “Thank God for dead soldiers' and “Thank God for IEDs' (IEDs are roadside bombs that have claimed many American soldiers' lives in Iraq). Protesters also shouted that soldiers will continue to die as long as America tolerates gays, Jews, and Catholics. A few weeks later, Albert Snyder (Cpl. Matthew Snyder's father) saw a posting on Westboro Church's website that scorned him, saying that he had raised his son to serve the devil, and had taught his son about adultery and divorce. Snyder told CNN that he felt physically sick after he read that post. On June 5, 2006, Albert Snyder sued the Westboro church for defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of distress. The suit claims that the Phelps should pay emotional damages, Snyder's court costs, and punitive damages for "reprehensible actions." At trial, Snyder described the severity of his emotional injuries. He testified that he is unable to separate the thought of his dead son from his thoughts of Westboro's picketing, and that he often becomes tearful, angry, and physically ill when he thinks about it. Expert witnesses testified that Snyder's emotional anguish had resulted in severe depression and had exacerbated preexisting health conditions. The plaintiff also claimed that the father of the dead Marine was "not a public figure" who could be expected to tolerate such an onslaught, but a private person who sought to "bury his son in peace." If the picketing had taken place at the Pentagon or Capitol Hill, no one would have questioned the Phelps' right to carry their signs, even with their offensive messages. But the father was a private figure, not a public person, and the protest was a targeted assault on a private memorial service so it is not covered by the 1st Amendment. The defense claims that the protest was conducted in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of local officials, and were therefore protected under the 1st Amendment, that the government cannot punish words or ideas simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. Second, the members of the church "had the right to be where they were." They were picketing on a public street 1,000 feet from the site of the funeral; they complied with the law and with instructions from the police, and they protested quietly and without violence.
