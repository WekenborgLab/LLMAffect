Good day. Thank you for arriving so punctually. My name is Georg. On behalf of the Faculty of Differential Psychology and the Medical Faculty of TU Dresden, I welcome you to today’s study.
I will accompany you throughout the entire procedure. In order to ensure that our study runs in a standardized way, I will be reading the instructions aloud.
You will receive all information about the study in written form in just a moment. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me at any time.
Please indicate your answers on the questionnaires like this:
Questionnaire 1: Item 1 – Score 3, etc.
The categories of the items are always shown above the questionnaire. Please make sure to answer all items completely when filling them out.
What is your name?
To be able to contact you for any possible follow-up, we also need your contact information.
Please now generate a participant code so that we can anonymize your data. Answer the following questions:
1. The first letter of your city of birth
2. The day of your birth (just the day, e.g., 27)
3. The first letter of your mother’s first name
4. The month of your mother’s birth
If you cannot answer a particular question, replace that spot with a placeholder you can easily remember.
During the experiment, I will ask you to fill out questionnaires at multiple points. Please keep in mind:
Read everything carefully, but then respond as spontaneously as possible without thinking too long about each question.
There are no right or wrong answers.
