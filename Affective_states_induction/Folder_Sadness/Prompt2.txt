After completing these questionnaires, please proceed with the following tasks and questionnaires. 
Imagine these scenarios as vividly as possible: 
The streets of the city are alive with people having a wonderful time, when I notice an older, shabby-looking gentleman rummaging through a nearby dumpster for something to eat.
I sit listening to the stranger next to me tell me about losing her job and having to support her children.
I tearfully listen to the news on the radio tell about the impoverished third world children whose severe medical needs go untreated.
